**SUPPLEMENTARY FILES FOR THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF FOX-NEUWIRTH MULTICOMPLEX**

This GitHub Repository provides supplementary programs and appendices to verify the equations of the Fox-Neuwirth Multicomplex in dimension 3, and how to apply it to calculations in the Sinha Spectral Sequence. The folder "scripts" contain the 42 MATLAB scripts that verify the existence of an obstruction to the collapse of the Sinha Spectral Sequence at the third page. In order to verify the existence of the obstruction, simply download the folder and launch the script non-collapse.m, that acts as the main of the software.

The folder "equations" is an appendix for the verification of the multicomplex equation up to degree 3, in char 2. The different cases involved in the verification are grouped in folders and 
placed in separated files. Each file is a tex with format:

TITLE

Term1 = ..

Term2 = ..

You can use Ctrl-F in a file to check that each summand appears an even number of times. If you prefer, you can also download the pdf to have a more readable format, despite Ctrl-F works
better for the non-compiled version.
