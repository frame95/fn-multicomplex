**HOW TO READ THE COMPUTATIONS**

Checking the multicomplex equation up to degree 3
requires several long cases. We grouped them in folders and 
placed in separated files. Each file is a tex with format:

TITLE

Term1 = ..

Term2 = ..

You can use Ctrl-F on each file to check each summand appears
an even number of times. If you prefer, you can also download
the pdf to have a more readable format, despite Ctrl-F works
better for the non-compiled version.
